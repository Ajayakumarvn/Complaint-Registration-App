1. Introduction
The Complaint Registration App is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows citizens to register complaints and seek resolution from government officials. The platform consists of four modules: District Collector, Sub Collector, Village Officer, and Citizen. Each module has specific roles and functionalities to facilitate the complaint resolution process effectively.

2. Technologies Used
The following technologies were utilized in the development of the Complaint Registration App:

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML/CSS: Markup language for structuring web pages and styling.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
Express.js: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database for storing data.
Additional Tools:

Mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB.
Axios: A library for making HTTP requests from Node.js and the browser.
3. System Architecture
The Complaint Registration App follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend and backend are decoupled. The frontend handles user interactions and rendering the user interface, while the backend manages data storage, business logic, and API endpoints.

The frontend is built using React.js and communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to the RESTful API endpoints provided by the Express.js server. The server interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

4. Modules
4.1 District Collector Module
The District Collector module is responsible for overseeing complaint resolution at the district level. It provides the following features:

View and manage complaints registered in the district.
Assign complaints to sub collectors or village officers for resolution.
Track the progress and status of complaints.
Communicate with sub collectors and village officers regarding complaint resolution.
Generate reports and statistics about complaint resolution.
4.2 Sub Collector Module
The Sub Collector module focuses on resolving complaints assigned by the District Collector. It offers the following features:

Receive assigned complaints from the District Collector.
Investigate and take necessary actions to resolve the complaints.
Communicate with village officers or citizens for additional information or updates.
Update the status and progress of complaints for the District Collector's review.
Generate reports on complaint resolution activities.
4.3 Village Officer Module
The Village Officer module deals with complaints specific to a particular village or area. It provides the following features:

Receive complaints assigned by the District Collector or Sub Collector.
Investigate and take necessary actions to resolve the complaints at the village level.
Communicate with citizens for additional information or updates.
Update the status and progress of complaints for the District Collector or Sub Collector's review.
Generate reports on complaint resolution activities at the village level.
4.4 Citizen Module
The Citizen module allows users to register complaints and seek resolution. It offers the following features:

Register complaints by providing relevant details and attaching supporting documents.
Track the status and progress of registered complaints.
Communicate with government officials for updates or additional information.
Receive notifications and updates on complaint resolution.
Provide feedback on the resolution process.
5. Installation
To install and run the Complaint Registration App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system if not already installed.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Install backend dependencies by running the command: npm install.
Install frontend dependencies by navigating to the client directory and running npm install.
Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection URL, API keys, etc.).
Start the backend server by running npm start in the project root directory.
Start the frontend development server by navigating to the client directory and running npm start.
Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
6. Usage
Once the Complaint Registration App is installed and running, users can access the web application and interact with the different modules based on their role. Here are some common usage scenarios:

District Collectors: District Collectors can view, manage, and assign complaints to sub collectors or village officers. They can track the progress and communicate with the assigned officials regarding complaint resolution.

Sub Collectors: Sub Collectors receive assigned complaints from the District Collector and take actions to resolve them. They investigate the complaints, communicate with citizens or village officers, and provide updates on the complaint status.

Village Officers: Village Officers receive complaints assigned by the District Collector or Sub Collector and work towards their resolution at the village level. They investigate complaints, communicate with citizens, and update the complaint status accordingly.

Citizens: Citizens can register complaints by providing necessary details and supporting documents. They can track the status and progress of their registered complaints, communicate with government officials for updates, and provide feedback on the resolution process.

Users can navigate the web application using the provided user interface and interact with the different modules based on their role and requirements.
